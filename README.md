# ha-dimplex-heatpump-modbus
HomeAssistant Custom Component for reading data from Dimplex DHW300 Heatpump through ModbusTCP.

unfortunately, this project is on hold - I consider to buy a dimplex heatpump, but I don't have one yet, so I can't really develop and test one.
A possible way to implement could be the following repository: https://github.com/chrpuf/smarthomeNG-DimplexWP
